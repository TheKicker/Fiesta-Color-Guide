<br> 

Often touted as 'The Most Famous Dinnerware in the World', Fiesta dinnerware has been a fan-favorite and an American icon since its introduction at the annual Pottery and Glass Exhibit in Pittsburgh during January of 1936. Designed in the bold Art Deco styling by Frederick Hurten Rhead, Fiesta dinnerware encourages you to mix and match for the perfect tablescape with their variety of colors.

This is an Unofficial Color Guide for Fiesta Dinnerware Colors from the beginning in 1936 to today, includes original and post 86 colors.  Uses publicly available resources, pictures, and online bloggers (linked below).

## Get Involved

This project is a hobby of mine, I've worked at The Fiesta Tableware Company (formerly Homer Laughlin) since 2014 in a variety of capacities. My father worked here before me since the 90's, and my mother was an employee of Hall China for a period of time. The release of the new colors every year has been something I've enjoyed both from the outside as a customer and fan, to now behind the scenes as Digital Marketing and Software Development takes me right into the mix of information/planning and release. 

Though I am an employee at The Fiesta Tableware Company, this project is not affiliated with or endorsed by them in any way.  I have been super careful not to accidentally release information about the new color every year, and have done a great deal of research to build this.
