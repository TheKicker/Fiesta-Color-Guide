Homer Laughlin replaces intermittent kilns with continuous firing tunnel kilns at Plant Nos. 4 and 5 to increase production. New Plant Nos. 6 and 7 open. Plants on the East End are phased out in favor of the largest Homer Laughlin plant, No. 8. with 800 employees and a total capacity equal to 160 upright kilns, all for making ware for Woolworth’s, at an average price of 72 cents per dozen. That amounts to 16.7 million pieces of ware sold to one customer in one year."
